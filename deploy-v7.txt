DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS FOR GCP CLOUD SHELL
=========================================

!! IMPORTANT: Backend v3 and Frontend v9 REQUIRED !!

1. Open GCP Cloud Shell at: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Run these commands one by one:

# Deploy Backend v3 (CORRECT Texas Hold'em structure with shared community cards)
kubectl set image deployment/poker-backend backend=gcr.io/texas-holdem-poker-3269/poker-backend:v3

# Wait for backend rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/poker-backend

# Deploy Frontend v9 (CORRECT UI with shared community cards)
kubectl set image deployment/poker-frontend frontend=gcr.io/texas-holdem-poker-3269/poker-frontend:v9

# Wait for frontend rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/poker-frontend

# Verify deployments
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods

3. After both rollouts complete, refresh your browser at:
   http://34.26.210.67

4. Test Compare Hands feature:
   - Enter 5 community cards (shared by both players)
   - Enter Player 1's 2 hole cards
   - Enter Player 2's 2 hole cards
   - Each player makes their best hand from 2 hole + 5 community cards

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Backend v3: 
  * Correct Texas Hold'em structure: ONE set of community cards shared by all players
  * Each player has 2 private hole cards
  * API now accepts: player1HoleCards, player2HoleCards, communityCards
  * ALL CSV test cases pass (verified with TestCompareHandsCSV)
  
- Frontend v9: 
  * UI redesigned: Community Cards section at top (shared)
  * Player 1 section: only 2 hole cards
  * Player 2 section: only 2 hole cards
  * Fixes DNS error (nginx proxy for /api/*)
  * Complete blue theme, "Community Cards" everywhere

- This matches the correct Texas Hold'em rules as shown in your test cases file

NOTE: These commands must be run in GCP Cloud Shell, not local PowerShell.
