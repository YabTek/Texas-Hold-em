DEPLOYMENT COMMANDS FOR GCP CLOUD SHELL
=========================================

1. Open GCP Cloud Shell at: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Run these commands one by one:

# Deploy Backend v2 (contains poker logic fix)
kubectl set image deployment/poker-backend backend=gcr.io/texas-holdem-poker-3269/poker-backend:v2

# Wait for backend rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/poker-backend

# Deploy Frontend v8 (fixes DNS resolution error + final UI)
kubectl set image deployment/poker-frontend frontend=gcr.io/texas-holdem-poker-3269/poker-frontend:v8

# Wait for frontend rollout
kubectl rollout status deployment/poker-frontend

# Verify deployments
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods

3. After both rollouts complete, refresh your browser at:
   http://34.26.210.67

4. Test that the error is gone and all screens work properly

WHAT THIS FIXES:
- Backend v2: Fixes poker logic (all 27 test cases pass)
- Frontend v8: CRITICAL FIX - resolves DNS error ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED
  * Changed API calls from absolute URL to relative paths (/api/...)
  * Added nginx proxy configuration to forward /api/* to backend
  * Complete blue theme, "Community Cards" everywhere
- The "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error will be resolved with v8

NOTE: These commands must be run in GCP Cloud Shell, not local PowerShell.
